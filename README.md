# User Management System - Console Application

The focus behind this console application is to create a package that will allow the system administrator to view, insert, modify, and delete users stored either to a local JSON file or through a RESTful API. This application is designed to be incorporated in different environments when needed, allowing the current console interface to be changed at a later date.
